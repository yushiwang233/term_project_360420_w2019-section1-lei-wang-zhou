- --Introduction\
  - Prisoner's Dilemma\
\
There are two prisoners: A and B. They have two options in each turn: cooperate (C) or defect (D). The possible situations will be:\
\
If A and B both cooperate, each of them will get 3 points\
\
If A cooperates but B defects, A will get 0 point and B will get 5 points\
\
If A defects but B cooperates, A will get 5 points and B will get 0 point.\
\
If A and B both defect, each of them will get 1 point.\

  - TIT FOR TAT\
\
It was the winner in Robert Axelrod's Prisoner's Dilemma experiment. It got the highest average score over games with all other players.\
\
It was submitted by mathematician Anatol Rapoport\
\
It cooperates on the first turn and then, on subsequent turns, does whatever the opponent did for its move on the previous turn. In other words, if the opponent chooses to cooperate, TIT FOR TAT will continue cooperating until the opponent defects. Once the opponent defects, TIT FOR TAT will punish that defection with a defection of its own on the next turn, but will forgive the opponent by cooperating once the opponent starts to cooperate again.\
\
- --Objective\
\
The objectives of our project are to use genetic algorithm to develop a strategy that allows us to win the prisoner's game and verify that our strategy is similar to TIT FOR TAT.\
